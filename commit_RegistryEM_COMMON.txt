Two Registry files are prepared

1. Registry/Registry.EM_COMMON.wrf
   Usual Registry.EM_COMMON file for WRF (WRF-Chem) runs
   To use this, create a symbolic link "Registry/Registry.EM_COMMON"
   
   ln -sf Registry/Registry.EM_COMMON.wrf Registry/Registry.EM_COMMON

2. Registry/Registry.EM_COMMON.flexpart
   Registry.EM_COMMON file prepared for Flexpart-WRF runs.
   History outputs (h) are limited to variables necessary for Flexpart-WRF runs.
   This will be useful to avoid unnecessarily large size for wrfout files.
   To use this, create a symbolic link "Registry/Registry.EM_COMMON"

   ln -sf Registry/Registry.EM_COMMON.flexpart Registry/Registry.EM_COMMON
